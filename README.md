# XMLWatchFolder
auto compose multiple page pdf from a folder with multiple image files

this is written as a hobby project after seeing some of my customers are combining multiple jpeg files manually with Acrobat and save as pdf. 

this pgm start a watch folder and read in XML file and use iTextSharp dll to merge all jpeg into a single multipage pdf based on the supply pdf document size ans set the trim box for production printing.
